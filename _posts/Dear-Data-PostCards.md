Tool Review 1:Voyant
Trends Graph doesn't seem to have an order for the X axis-The years aren't by the order in the folder [Number and thus chronological], and while you can upload individual items, you 
cannot upload multiple at once-so A zipped Corpus, can be uploaded, which contains 4 files, but you cannot select 4 items individually for simultaneous upload. 
Order isn't reverse of chronological, or by shortest to largest [or reverse], seemingly in just a random order. Checked to see if it might have been by date last modified.
That is a negative.
This might not be a problem if you could manipulate the order of the X-Axis, but you cannot.
In fact, it would appear the only manipulation of the graph you can do relates to the display of information helping to read the graph, such as changing it to an area graph, pure bar 
graph or the default bar and line graph, among small array of other options. 
The tool itself can be useful, in theory, but with the current level of user manipulation NOT present that would be needed to accurately display the data, I'd say it's uses are very
limited and require a footnote when used, to avoid misleading representation of the data. 

DreamScape attempts to map locations that are mentioned together.
It admits, using a Corpus of Jane Austen as an example, that it has a variety of problems, such as when the name of a person happens to coincide with a geographical location, it gets
mapped regardless. 
When using the newspaper, which would make sense to mention a plethora of place names, I clicked on Havana, Cuba. It gave me a little pop up, with a few options, and I choose the
'view occurrences' option. It proceeded to give a little context of the words preceding and following Havana. Of the nine occurrences listed (out of a max capacity of 25), 
a third of them directly referenced 'Little Havana', which upon googling, is actually a neighborhood in Miami [although it is named after the Cuban Capital], home to many Cuban exiles 
and Central/South American immigrants. One of the remaining two third of the occurrences included Miami in the sentence, and unfortunately the context given wasn't enough to tell if 
that or any of the remaining two thirds were also in reference to the Miami neighborhood instead of the Cuban Capital.
You can hide locations, which may be useful in instances where all usages of a 'location' aren't actually that location, but it would appear that you cannot manually insert a new 
location, and the smallest locations available are cities, which is understandable. 
It says it uses a Mercator projection for it's display of the world. 
There were filters that could be added, but they required Metadata that my corpus didn't have, so I could not attempt to use them. 
Definitely an interesting tool to play around with, but with so many inaccuracies, I would say it's praticallity is extremely limited. 


Tool Review 2:Palladio


For this review, I used the guide given on https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-network-diagrams-from-historical-sources and the Data given within.
Now, Palladio is a program that visualize historical data when plugged in correctly. 
This requires that you’ve already placed your data in a spreadsheet. 
Depending on how complex your data is, this may be the majority of the work you’ll have to do when using this tool. 
Once you’ve uploaded your spreadsheet(s) you’ll be required to set up the relation between any related spreadsheets, and specify the data type for specific columns, if they aren’t straightforward [For example, numbers are straightforward, but dates would have to be manually selected for the data type]. 
The visualization is simple and pretty straight forward, explicitly if you created a unipartite or 1-mode network (a representation between a source and a target node of a single type, through one or multiple relation types. IF you create a bipartite, or 2-mode networks (a representation [Which has 2 types of nodes, and requires that one node only touch a node of the opposite type] it can start to get a little more complex.
While the site itself doesn’t give much in terms of guidance, once your in the thick of it, most of the features of the tool are relatively self-explanatory, and if not, there is the above guide to assist on all fronts. I’d say that having to rely upon a third party weakens that as a plus, but it does elaborate on it in the FAQ, explicitly the tutorial section, which can be accessed from a link when you first visit the website. As for the rest of the FAQ, it provides help in relation to proper formatting for the spreadsheets, and  how to save and export [although it is only intended to be viewed upon the same website].
I don’t have any actual formal complaints with the website or tool. 
One specific feature I like would have to be the scalable node size. It explicitly can scale the node based on actor attributes. While the sample Data I used wasn’t in an explicitly compatible format for that feature, it certainly has the potential to help make the visualization even more easily interpretable. 

Something I would also like to give them props for is that the site itself [not just the guide] has the ability to test the tool with sample data. Sample Data, I must point out, that has already been formatted correctly, in addition to any of the other work you would have to do, before being able to use the visualization tools, allowing one to dive right in, and start seeing how the tools work. I’d say that maybe an even better experience for people unsure of whether to use the tool, than a trailer or review could give, in the sense of a no-stakes fun. 
On the note of reviews, they actually link several testimonials on their website, under the category of the same name. Under this label, they also list several 3rd party tutorials, alongside mentions, courses, and publications. 


Final Project Transcript:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJOPctdBdm8
Greetings, one and all, to the First episode of our new Podcast about Media Archaeology.
Now, you might be wondering how our intro relates to the podcast.

Afterall, I mean, what could a British Chap Hop artist singing about Steam Punk have to do with Media Archaeology?

Well, the key here is Steam Punk. Steam Punk is not interested in a universal model of technological progress. It instead examines alternative paths, quirky paths,
and novel ideas resulting from traversing said paths, which tend to fall outside of the mainstream. 

But how does that relate to Media Archaeology?

Well, Steam punk is a good symbol for the media-archaeological spirit of thinking the new and the old in parallel lines, and cultivating enthusiasm for 
media, technology and science through aesthetics, politics and other fields of critical inquiry.

Certainly
You know, thinking of the listeners out there who might be unfamiliar with the concept of Media Archaeology, I'd say it would probably be beneficial to, well, define
Media Archaeology, which we'll sometimes refer to as MA, especially since this is the first episode of our podcast.

That is a quite a good point. Unfortunately, the definition is quite so cut and dry, which is why I was hoping to delay giving it, but we'd have to do it eventually...

Well, not just eventually, you should've been preparing to give it as soon as possible, especially given that!

Ok, so obviously the definition varies depending on who you ask, but it *CAN* mean:
The recurring topics of Media Culture;
A poetic exploration of deep times and variantology [although variantology is itself a loaded term, that relates to the Relations of the Arts, Sciences and 
Technologies];
A theoretical opening to think about material media cultures in a historical perspective;
It expands into an experimental set of questioning about time, obsolescence, and alternative histories
It's also about analyzing the conditions of existence of media cultural objects, processes and phenomena;
One could even try to define it as German Media Theory merged with some concepts from Cultural Theory.

So I counted 4 definitions there, with 2 related additions-that's quite a bit.

Yeah.

So, quickly jumping back, Steam Punk and MA both are keen to focus on 19th Century as foundation of Modernity;
in terms of: Science, Tech, and Birth of Media Capitalism.

So you're saying that Steam Punk and MA have even more in common.

Yeah. 

That's it about Steam Punk for now though.

Are you sure? I was really hoping to maybe pitch this podcast to some people at conventions...

I'm sure, although I can't speak for future episodes. 

Alright.

One thing I would like to clarify it that MA relates to but it distinct from Media History.

Could you elaborate on this? 

All in good time.
So, MA potentially serves as an answer to the need to think transdisciplinary in relation to questions of art, science, philosophy and technology.

I notice you didn't include History there.

Well, that's because I thought I had emphasized the historical aspect plenty for the time being.

Oh, sorry. 

Anyways, MA borrows as happily from film studies and media arts as it does from the historical set of methods

[quietly]He knows he hasn't emphasized it enough.

[Silence]

MA has never been only a purely academic endeavor, but interestingly enough, it has been observed by artists, who use themes ideas, and inspirations 
from media of old in part to investigate alongside MA what newness in 'new media' means.

Now, let me tell you what MA is not.
While one can look at the potentials of the media-archaeological method in digital culture research, MA is not an archaeology of digital culture.

Well, you had already mentioned the transdiscplinary nature of MA.

.....
Anyways, moving on, 
I would say MA is a way to investigate the new media cultures through insights from past new media, often with an emphasis on the forgotten, the quirky, 
the non-obvious apparatuses, practices and inventions.
Oh, and also a way to analyze the regimes of memory and creative practices in media culture – both theoretical and artistic.


So, Media Archaeologists see media culture as sedimented, layered-fold of time and materiality, where past can become relevant again and new tech can become 
obsolete quickly.

Now, that sounds like Archaeology.


Indeed it does.

	You can look towards 8-bit sounds, as evidence; due to nostalgia, revival and retroculture, it is just as natural as cutting edge tech is in the 
	digital-culture landscape. 
	Death of Media is mourned [see Vinyl TurnTable, and Sony Walkman]
	Lost Formats have their own Preservationists [See our video on Mac Paint].
	Abandonware-Early Games from the 90's, being preserved on the net, in a 'zombie like' sort of afterlife.
		Oh, for those of you who don't know, Abandonware is a product, typically software, ignored by its owner and manufacturer, and for which no support 
		is available.
	Media Consumption Practices are also becoming Retro, like Vinyl Listening Clubs in London. 
This can all be explained by nostalgia from the current young consuming middle class.


Ah, so like the Pokémon Go boom in 2016...


Those 4 years have just flown by, but I guess time is Relative.
All that talk about nostalgia relates to a theory, that New Media Remediates old Media.

Can you elaborate on that?

While New Media is changing habits, old media never really left.
Currently remediated resurfacing, finding new uses, contexts, adaptations.
Lots of 'dead media' discussed today are actually zombie media, living deads that found afterlife in new contexts: hands, screens, or machines. 
		
So despite the perspective of Globalized Information Culture, in which everything seems to be speeding up faster than we humans can process,
a fascination with the past is being cultivated?

Exactly. 

Recall how I mentioned the transdisciplinary nature of MA? 
The next theory actually stems from Theorists who's work or theory was in the Archaeology of knowledge and culture.
They emphasized it as a methodology for excavating conditions of existence. 

[same speaker]
Archaeology in this sense, means examining the reasons in the background that contribute to, for media archaeology, a 
media apparatus or use habit is able to into creation, be popularized and sustain itself in a cultural situation. 

Another theorist builds upon that, demanding a media technological understanding of that archaeological  methodology.
Such Conditions of Existence are not only discursive, but relate to both media networks and scientific discoveries. 

This theorist desired to look at technical media exactly how the first looked at archives of books and written documents.

And That's where we'll cut off our first episode! Thank you for listening!
