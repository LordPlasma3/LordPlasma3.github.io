Tool Review 1:Voyant
Trends Graph doesn't seem to have an order for the X axis-The years aren't by the order in the folder [Number and thus chronological], and while you can upload individual items, you 
cannot upload multiple at once-so A zipped Corpus, can be uploaded, which contains 4 files, but you cannot select 4 items individually for simultaneous upload. 
Order isn't reverse of chronological, or by shortest to largest [or reverse], seemingly in just a random order. Checked to see if it might have been by date last modified.
That is a negative.
This might not be a problem if you could manipulate the order of the X-Axis, but you cannot.
In fact, it would appear the only manipulation of the graph you can do relates to the display of information helping to read the graph, such as changing it to an area graph, pure bar 
graph or the default bar and line graph, among small array of other options. 
The tool itself can be useful, in theory, but with the current level of user manipulation NOT present that would be needed to accurately display the data, I'd say it's uses are very
limited and require a footnote when used, to avoid misleading representation of the data. 

DreamScape attempts to map locations that are mentioned together.
It admits, using a Corpus of Jane Austen as an example, that it has a variety of problems, such as when the name of a person happens to coincide with a geographical location, it gets
mapped regardless. 
When using the newspaper, which would make sense to mention a plethora of place names, I clicked on Havana, Cuba. It gave me a little pop up, with a few options, and I choose the
'view occurrences' option. It proceeded to give a little context of the words preceding and following Havana. Of the nine occurrences listed (out of a max capacity of 25), 
a third of them directly referenced 'Little Havana', which upon googling, is actually a neighborhood in Miami [although it is named after the Cuban Capital], home to many Cuban exiles 
and Central/South American immigrants. One of the remaining two third of the occurrences included Miami in the sentence, and unfortunately the context given wasn't enough to tell if 
that or any of the remaining two thirds were also in reference to the Miami neighborhood instead of the Cuban Capital.
You can hide locations, which may be useful in instances where all usages of a 'location' aren't actually that location, but it would appear that you cannot manually insert a new 
location, and the smallest locations available are cities, which is understandable. 
It says it uses a Mercator projection for it's display of the world. 
There were filters that could be added, but they required Metadata that my corpus didn't have, so I could not attempt to use them. 
Definitely an interesting tool to play around with, but with so many inaccuracies, I would say it's praticallity is extremely limited. 


Tool Review 2:Palladio


For this review, I used the guide given on https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-network-diagrams-from-historical-sources and the Data given within.
Now, Palladio is a program that visualize historical data when plugged in correctly. 
This requires that you’ve already placed your data in a spreadsheet. 
Depending on how complex your data is, this may be the majority of the work you’ll have to do when using this tool. 
Once you’ve uploaded your spreadsheet(s) you’ll be required to set up the relation between any related spreadsheets, and specify the data type for specific columns, if they aren’t straightforward [For example, numbers are straightforward, but dates would have to be manually selected for the data type]. 
The visualization is simple and pretty straight forward, explicitly if you created a unipartite or 1-mode network (a representation between a source and a target node of a single type, through one or multiple relation types. IF you create a bipartite, or 2-mode networks (a representation [Which has 2 types of nodes, and requires that one node only touch a node of the opposite type] it can start to get a little more complex.
While the site itself doesn’t give much in terms of guidance, once your in the thick of it, most of the features of the tool are relatively self-explanatory, and if not, there is the above guide to assist on all fronts. I’d say that having to rely upon a third party weakens that as a plus, but it does elaborate on it in the FAQ, explicitly the tutorial section, which can be accessed from a link when you first visit the website. As for the rest of the FAQ, it provides help in relation to proper formatting for the spreadsheets, and  how to save and export [although it is only intended to be viewed upon the same website].
I don’t have any actual formal complaints with the website or tool. 
One specific feature I like would have to be the scalable node size. It explicitly can scale the node based on actor attributes. While the sample Data I used wasn’t in an explicitly compatible format for that feature, it certainly has the potential to help make the visualization even more easily interpretable. 

Something I would also like to give them props for is that the site itself [not just the guide] has the ability to test the tool with sample data. Sample Data, I must point out, that has already been formatted correctly, in addition to any of the other work you would have to do, before being able to use the visualization tools, allowing one to dive right in, and start seeing how the tools work. I’d say that maybe an even better experience for people unsure of whether to use the tool, than a trailer or review could give, in the sense of a no-stakes fun. 
On the note of reviews, they actually link several testimonials on their website, under the category of the same name. Under this label, they also list several 3rd party tutorials, alongside mentions, courses, and publications.
